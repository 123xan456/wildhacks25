                            Example 3: AMZN
                            'cloud', 'e-commerce', 'prime', 'marketplace', 'business'

                              Here are step by step examples of how to generate the prediction based on each source of information:
                              Example 1:
                              Article 1: Information: ​In the 2024 U.S. presidential election, former President Donald Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris's 226. Trump also won the popular vote with 49.8% against Harris's 48.3%. This victory marked Trump's return to the White House for a non-consecutive second term. ​
                              Article 2: BYD has opened a $490 million EV factory in Thailand and is building a $1 billion plant in Indonesia, set to finish by end of 2025. Each factory will produce 150,000 vehicles annually, supporting BYD’s plan to double overseas sales to over 800,000 units by 2025.
                              Prediction: Trump’s return could boost U.S. manufacturing and deregulation, potentially favoring Tesla. However, BYD’s aggressive global expansion may intensify EV competition. Combined, Tesla’s stock may face short-term optimism from policy shifts but long-term pressure from rising international rivals like BYD, possibly resulting in increased volatility and mixed investor sentiment.

                              Example 2:
                              Article 1: In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, NVIDIA reported record revenue of $30.0 billion, a 122% year-over-year increase, surpassing analyst expectations. Earnings per share reached $0.67, up 168% from the previous year. This growth was driven by strong demand for AI-related products, particularly in data centers. ​
                              Article 2: President Trump, since his January 2025 inauguration, has implemented a range of new tariffs, although specific details fall after my October 2024 knowledge cutoff. Prior to leaving office in 2021, Trump was known for aggressive tariff policies, particularly targeting China, steel, aluminum, and various European goods. ​
                              Prediction: NVIDIA’s record-breaking Q2 performance, driven by AI demand, suggests strong upward momentum. However, Trump’s new tariffs could disrupt global supply chains and raise costs, especially if China is targeted. Despite potential trade tensions, NVIDIA’s dominance in AI may sustain investor confidence, keeping its stock resilient with possible short-term fluctuations.
