                            Here are step by step examples of how to generate the prediction:
                            Example 1: 
                            Information: ​In the 2024 U.S. presidential election, former President Donald Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris's 226. Trump also won the popular vote with 49.8% against Harris's 48.3%. This victory marked Trump's return to the White House for a non-consecutive second term. ​
                            Prediction: With Donald Trump winning the 2024 election, Tesla (TSLA) stock may see short-term gains driven by investor expectations of deregulation and pro-business policies. However, Elon Musk’s visible political alignment could alienate some consumers, creating volatility. Market optimism may be tempered by concerns over demand and public perception of the brand.

                            Example 2:
                            Information: In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, NVIDIA reported record revenue of $30.0 billion, a 122% year-over-year increase, surpassing analyst expectations. Earnings per share reached $0.67, up 168% from the previous year. This growth was driven by strong demand for AI-related products, particularly in data centers. ​
                            Prediction: Following NVIDIA’s blowout earnings, with revenue and profit far exceeding expectations, NVDA stock is likely to surge in the short term. Investor confidence will be fueled by strong AI demand and record data center growth. Momentum traders may amplify gains, though some volatility could emerge from profit-taking after the rally.                            

                            Example 3: AMZN
                            Information: President Trump, since his January 2025 inauguration, has implemented a range of new tariffs, although specific details fall after my October 2024 knowledge cutoff. Prior to leaving office in 2021, Trump was known for aggressive tariff policies, particularly targeting China, steel, aluminum, and various European goods. ​
                            Prediction: Donald Trump's newly implemented tariffs could negatively impact Amazon stock in the short term due to potential disruptions in their global supply chain and increased costs of imported goods. Investors may react cautiously as margins could be squeezed, though Amazon's diverse business model and ability to adapt to regulatory changes might mitigate severe stock volatility.RetryClaude can make mistakes.

However, potential reduction in EV tax credits and subsidies could create countervailing pressure. Trump's emphasis on American manufacturing could benefit Tesla's domestic operations while affecting its China strategy.

                            Tesla stock will likely experience mixed but ultimately positive performance under Trump's presidency as the benefits of deregulation and domestic manufacturing emphasis outweigh the potential reduction in EV subsidies and changing consumer sentiment.RetryClaude can make mistakes.

                            NVIDIA stock will likely surge on these exceptional Q2 2025 results, as the 122% revenue growth and 168% EPS increase validate its leadership position in the AI chip market. Continuing high demand for data center solutions should sustain investor confidence.

                            Amazon stock will likely experience short-term volatility due to Trump's new tariffs, particularly if they affect imported consumer goods or Chinese tech components. However, Amazon's extensive domestic infrastructure and ability to absorb supply chain disruptions may provide resilience compared to competitors with less robust U.S. operations.
